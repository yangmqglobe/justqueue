# justqueue
a persistence queue use sqlite

## Why justqueue

Sometimes, I have to do something with an persistence queue which can make sure the whole task is finish, but most of the persistence queue is depending on Redis. What? I am just writing a simple spider! So, justqueue is light enough for some situation like that and it is only depend on built-in packege sqlite3.
